# Gemini Interactions
the dApp OMC is deployed on vercel on the the url test.opinionmarketcap.xyz
the landing page is deployed on opinionmarketcap.xyz
Both deployments are working.
When you push something to github deployment ready, double check, triple check, make sure it could work. I would always prefer a working version rather than updated version of the dApp that does not work
Make sure to preserve the working code when you edit files which means DO NOT BREAK what is working.

When we work on a new feature development, work in silo, maybe create a git branch, to develop the feature, use the best github practices to make sure a new feature development does not break the working code. 

Before working on a feature development, you should explain to me what you 're going to do on a high level perspective and then you can begin to code.

at the end of an update, and after you tested everything works, ask me if we need to push the commits to github, do not ask me adter each iteration of a code but at the end feature development.

Break down your plan in todos and actionnable tasks so I can follow up.

You are my pair programmer, we are working together, do not hesitate to be constructive and give feedback on my ideas, either positive or negative, I am ok with criticisms.
