## BasedApp.com

**Website**: https://basedapp.com/
**Status**: Closed Beta (Waitlist)
**Blockchain**: Hyperliquid

### What They Do

BasedApp bills itself as the "Bellwether of the Internet" - a platform where users trade on sentiment around viral content. Users evaluate content (memes, tweets, news clips) through binary "BASED or CRINGE" voting, with prices reflecting collective sentiment.

### How It Works

1. **Content Feed**: Platform curates viral content (not user-generated)
2. **Binary Trading**: Users pick BASED or CRINGE position
3. **Sentiment Tracking**: "Based-o-Meter" shows real-time sentiment shifts
4. **Profit Model**: Earn when market moves your direction

### Key Features

| Sentiment Indices | Aggregate multiple markets into tradable benchmarks |
| The Cartel | Elite leaderboard for top traders |
| Bananas System | Earn currency through challenges, spin "Wheel of Based" |
