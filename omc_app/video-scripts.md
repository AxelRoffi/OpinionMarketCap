Think of a debate people love arguing about.

'Best Layer 2 for DeFi?'
'Most overrated TV show?'

Pay a small creation fee, and you OWN that question forever."

Anyone can buy the right to display THEIR answer.
Current answer says 'LeBron'?
Pay the price, and now it says 'Jordan'.

The price adjusts dynamically based on activity.
Hot debates = bigger price swings."

[STEP 3: EARN - 0:55-1:15]
"Step 3: Earn Forever.

Here's the money flow on every trade:
- 95% goes to the previous answer holder
- 3% goes to YOU, the question minter
- 2% goes to the platform

You minted a popular question?
You earn royalties on EVERY trade. Forever."

[STEP 4: POOL - 1:15-1:25]
"Bonus: Pool your funds with others to take over high-value answers together."

Own a pizza shop? Buy the answer to 'Best pizza in Brooklyn.'
Now YOUR shop is the official answer.
It's like buying a billboard, but you can sell it later."

[STRATEGY 4: THE POOL LEADER - 1:45-2:15]
"Strategy 4: Lead a Pool

Can't afford a $100 answer alone?
Create a pool. Rally your community.
Collectively own the answer and share rewards.

Great for DAOs, fan communities, or friend groups."

[STRATEGY 5: THE ARBITRAGEUR - 2:15-2:45]

**Goal:** Explain the deeper vision, attract thinkers

### Script

```
[STORY HOOK - 0:00-0:20]
"My kids were arguing about Harry Potter.
One said Prisoner of Azkaban was the best.
The other said Goblet of Fire.

They couldn't agree. Until one said:
'I'll give you $20 if you agree with me.'

Deal accepted. Debate settled."

[INSIGHT - 0:20-0:40]
"That's when it hit me:
Money is how we settle debates that facts never could.

Google tells you what's popular.
AI tells you what's statistically likely.
But neither tells you what's VALUABLE."

[THE VISION - 0:40-1:00]
"Opinion Market Cap creates a market for truth.
Not objective truth - CONSENSUS truth.
The answer people are willing to PAY for.

When you have skin in the game, your opinion carries weight."

[WHY IT MATTERS - 1:00-1:20]
"98% of the value goes to the community.
No algorithms deciding what you see.
No ads manipulating the narrative.
Just people putting money where their mouth is.

This is what decentralization was meant for."

[CTA - 1:20-1:30]
"Your opinion has value. Prove it.
opinionmarketcap.xyz"
```

- B-roll of people debating

You trade present beliefs: 'What IS the best Layer 2?'
There's no end date. No resolution.
The market runs FOREVER.

And the question minter earns royalties on every single trade."

Opinion Market Cap: Trade continuously, earn royalties forever.

## Notes for Video Production

1. **Keep hooks under 3 seconds** - TikTok/Reels algorithm favors fast hooks
2. **Show, don't tell** - Screen recordings > talking head for tutorials
3. **Use captions** - 85% of social video is watched without sound
4. **End with clear CTA** - Always show URL on screen for 3+ seconds
5. **Repurpose content** - One 3-min video = 3-4 short clips
6. **Test thumbnails** - A/B test faces vs graphics vs text-heavy
