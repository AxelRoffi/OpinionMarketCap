- Address: `0x21d8Cff98E50b1327022e786156749CcdBcE9d5e`
- Type: UUPS Proxy
- Issue: BaseScan didn't show functions properly

## 🎯 What Should Work Now

### BaseScan Interface
1. **Read Contract tab:** Shows all view functions
2. **Write Contract tab:** Shows all transaction functions
3. **Function calls:** Work directly from browser

### Frontend Interface
1. **Total Opinions:** Should show "3" instead of "0"
2. **Opinion List:** Should display all 3 opinions
3. **Wallet Connection:** Connect to Base Sepolia (Chain ID 84532)
4. **Transaction Submission:** Should work for answer submissions

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

If frontend still shows 0 opinions:

1. **Clear Browser Cache:** Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
2. **Check Network:** Ensure wallet is on Base Sepolia
3. **Verify Connection:** Wallet should show connected
4. **Console Errors:** Check browser console for errors

## 🎉 Ready to Test

The frontend is now updated with the correct contract address and should display all 3 opinions immediately. The contract is fully functional and all BaseScan functions are visible.
