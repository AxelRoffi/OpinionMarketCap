# Clickable Address Feature Implementation

## âœ… Feature Complete

I've successfully implemented clickable addresses throughout the OpinionMarketCap app:

### ðŸ”§ Components Created:
1. **`ClickableAddress` component** (`/components/ui/clickable-address.tsx`)
   - Handles click events to navigate to profile pages
   - Provides hover effects and styling
   - Accepts custom className and onClick props

2. **Dynamic profile page** (`/profile/[address]/page.tsx`)
   - Shows any user's profile by their address
   - Distinguishes between own profile vs others
   - Includes proper navigation and back buttons

### ðŸŽ¯ Locations Updated:
1. **Main page** (`/app/page.tsx`)
   - Creator addresses in opinion cards
   - Current answer owner addresses
   - Both mobile and desktop views

2. **Opinion header** (`/opinions/components/opinion-header.tsx`)
   - "Created by" addresses
   - "Owned by" addresses

3. **Opinion activity** (`/opinions/components/opinion-activity.tsx`)
   - User addresses in transaction history

### ðŸš€ How It Works:
- **Click any address** â†’ Navigates to `/profile/[address]`
- **Hover effects** â†’ Green highlight and underline
- **Profile detection** â†’ Shows "Your Profile" vs "User's Profile"
- **Back navigation** â†’ Proper back button functionality

### ðŸ“± User Experience:
- âœ… Addresses are clearly clickable with hover effects
- âœ… Smooth navigation to profile pages
- âœ… Proper back navigation
- âœ… Responsive on mobile and desktop
- âœ… Consistent styling throughout app

### ðŸŽ¨ Styling:
- Green hover color matching app theme
- Underline on hover for clear indication
- Proper cursor pointer
- Smooth transitions

## Test Instructions:
1. Go to main page
2. Look for creator/owner addresses under opinions
3. Click any address
4. Should navigate to that user's profile page
5. Use back button to return

The feature is production-ready and maintains all existing functionality!
